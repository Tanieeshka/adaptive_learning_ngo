# Sahay – Peer Learning Matchmaking System 🎓🤝

**Sahay** is an adaptive peer-learning platform designed to bridge educational gaps for NGO and college students by intelligently pairing learners based on subject strengths, weaknesses, academic year, and availability.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement
NGO students face multiple challenges that hinder effective learning:

- **High Student–Teacher Ratio:** Many NGOs operate with ratios as high as 1:40, making personalized attention difficult.
- **Limited Resources:** Students come from diverse academic backgrounds; traditional one-size-fits-all teaching often leaves many behind.
- **Low Digital Literacy:** Nearly **60–80% of rural students** struggle with digital learning tools, widening learning gaps.

These challenges result in uneven learning outcomes and reduced student confidence.

## 💡 Our Solution
**Sahay** enables structured and supportive **peer-to-peer learning** by leveraging student strengths within the same learning community.

### Key Solution Highlights
- **Skill-Based Matching:** Students specify subjects they are strong in and where they need help.
- **Rubric-Based Algorithm:** A compatibility score identifies the best mentor–mentee pairs.
- **Adaptive Motivation:** Mentors earn **credits, badges, and recognition** after successful sessions.
- **Support Escalation:** AI assistance and faculty support are available when peers cannot resolve doubts.
